# The Senior Hacker's Curriculum - Level 4
If you're a Senior then congratulations.  You problably have been in the field much longer than I have and I am in no place to lecture you.  Since this level is related to cutting-edge reseach, much of the stuff I can hope to post here will be "old news."

## So What now..?
I personally think staying invovled in the Cyber Security Community is where a senior is likely going to put their attention.  Conventions, Security News, Blogs, and Social Media of other top hackers.  At this point, I feel it's a responsiblity to stay up to date with the latest Cyber Security breaches and news.
